## Lemon Code

Lemon Code was originally a text-based grade curving application I made in Python when I was 15 for my computer science class.
This is a slightly modified version of the program and has been converted to C to help me practice my C programming skills and memory management skills.

Since Lemon Code does not have any file requirements, you can simply download the code from GitHub or paste it into a C file to run it.

Lemon Code is inteded for teachers to help them curve their students grades. This application can be used for homeworks, exams, or the students' overall grades.

All are welcome to use Lemon Code or build off of it free of charge for personal or commercial use.
